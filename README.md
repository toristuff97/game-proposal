My proposal for the Mod 1 project!

# Bass Champion!

## Rules of the Game
This is basically a Guitar Hero clone. When the note circles reach the hit zone, the player must tap the corresponding key on their keyboard. The "two-player" aspect is that they must have a higher score or possibly a higher accuracy rate than the Computer (which will have its accuracy randomized within a certain range). I would like there to be two different possible lose states, one for if they get a lower score than the Computer and one for if their accuracy dips below 60%, at which point they will be booed off the stage (like in the real game, you see lol). The player also has the option to tap their space bar to activate Star Power, which gives them a multiplier on their score.
## Technical Challenges


## Wireframes 
The screen you see when the page is first opened. The BASS CHAMPION will glow (ideally).

The screen you're taken to when you click "HOW TO PLAY" on the start screen

The screen you're taken to when you click "CONTROLS" on the start screen

Once you click "CLICK TO START" on the start screen, you get to pick which song you want to play here. (Clicking on any part of the song box will play a preview of it, while clicking on the play button will take you to the play screen.)

This is what the actual play screen will look like (the computer's note track is shown on the right, the player's note track is on the left side.)

This just shows all the icons/elements i "drew" and what they are specifically. Also an alternate story for the game.
